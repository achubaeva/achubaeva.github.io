      <h4>Anna Chubaeva</h4>
      <p>I recently graduated from Columbia University in 2018 with B.A. in Biochemistry. I am passionate about technology trends as well as its application in healthcare & life sciences.
        
        <p>
        As an undergrad, I worked at our campus publication, Columbia Spectator, as a Data Analytics associate.
        I used R, Facebook Insights, and Google Analytics to monitor and improve Columbia Spectator's social media presence
        and content performance. I wanted to take data analytics further and enrolled in an introductory
        computer science course to learn Python - and I've been hooked on programming ever since! </p><p>
          I now work in the tech industry at IBM where I study the tech services market and advise market leaders and executives on business strategy, product development, and sales. 
          I also enjoy programming as a hobby to create games, productivity apps, and workflows automation scripts.

            <p>I support IBM Services by advising business unit leaders and key executives  via projects 
              involving product positioning, go-to-to-market strategy, and sales enablement. I also work on creating internal workflow tools 
              using Python/Jupyter Notebooks/Tableau to automate data collection, drive innovative analysis, and create interactive dashboards. </p>

        <p>I assisted in building an interactive dashboard that tracks market, consumer, and financial data for 20+ IBM Digital Products. 
          Using the data, I evaluated the health of a subset of IBM's digital portfolio to deliver actionable insights to our executive 
          clients within IBM's Digital Busiess Group on how to improve its market positioning.
